# Week-3-Summary

 ### Day 13 - Introduction to Selenium with JavaScript
 On day 13, I learnt about what are Performance Testing and its different types. Also I learnt about wiht is K6 and how to use it for load testing.

 I applied the concepts of performance testing by creating a test file which consist of a test written in K6 language for testing Fake Store API("https://fakestoreapi.com"). In this way, we can check how much an API can handle the load during the runtime.

### Day 14 - Advanced Load Testing Scenarios
On day 14, I learnt about what is testing the code using Chat GPT and K6 for testing an API request. Also I learnt about how to ramp up and ramp down an API request during load testing.

I applied this concept by using the previous project and then ramping up the request and then ramping down the request. In this way, we can check if that API request can handle as many request.
